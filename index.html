    <h1> Making a game </h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p> It was my first tech project ever in middle school. I really enjoyed breaking
        down what exactly goes into a game and all the things that most players playing the game
        wouldn't really think about. It really helped me think about everything
        differently because after making the game, I started thinking about the behind the scene
        of everything.
